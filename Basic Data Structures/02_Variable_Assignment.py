#No need to give the datatype of the variable.
#just initialize it and give it a value.

my_dog="raja"

#No need to give semi colon in python.

#Python uses dynamic typing it means we can reassign a variable to different data type.

my_dog=[1, "hello", 40.2] #string changed to list

my_dog=2 #list changes to integer.

#we can use type() operation to see what is the type of data stored in the variable.


print(type (my_dog)) #output-> interger as the value which was last assigned is 2

my_dog={"name":"raja", "species":"dog", "age":4}

print(type(my_dog)) #output-> Dictionary
